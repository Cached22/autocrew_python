- **Multiple Script Generation**: Supports creation of various scripts for different objectives.
- **Team Ranking Functionality**: Evaluates and ranks agent teams based on effectiveness and goal alignment.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key (for Ollama interactions)
- Basic knowledge of Python and command-line operations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yanniedog/crewai-autocrew.git
   cd crewai-autocrew
   ```
3. Install Python 3.x if not already installed: [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
4. Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
5. Install necessary dependencies:
